# 🧠 TinyLogics

Welcome to **TinyLogics** — a growing collection of small, fun, and curious programs I’ve written while learning different programming languages. This repo is a reflection of my coding journey, one logic at a time.

---

## 📌 What is TinyLogics?

**TinyLogics** is my personal sandbox of code — a place where I experiment, build, and learn. These aren't big projects or polished apps, but rather bite-sized programs that helped me understand core concepts, solve logic problems, or just tinker around with code.

Whether it’s a quick C snippet, a Java logic challenge, or a mini script in Python — if I learned something from it, it probably ended up here.

## 📂 Projects in This Repo

Here are some of the mini-programs you'll find in this collection:

- 🎲 **Guess My Number** — A simple number guessing game
- 🧮 **Calculator** — A basic calculator that handles arithmetic operations
- 📧 **Email Sender** — A Python script to send emails via SMTP
- 🌐 **Internet Speed Tester** — Check your network speed using Python
- 🔢 **Binary to Decimal Converter** — A logic to convert binary numbers
- 🧵 **String Reversal** — Quick logic to reverse any string
- 🧩 **Palindrome Checker** — Verify if a given string is a palindrome
- 📊 **Sorting Algorithms** — Bubble sort, insertion sort, and more
- 🔠 **Character Counter** — Count occurrences of characters in a string
- ...and more to come!

## 💡 Why This Repo?

* To track my learning progress across multiple languages  
* To keep my small code experiments organized  
* To revisit, reflect, and improve old code over time  
* Maybe even help someone else who's learning too!

## 🧰 Languages Used

You'll find code in a mix of:

* C  
* Java  
* Python  
* (and maybe more as I explore!)

## 📈 Work in Progress

This is a living repo. As I continue learning, I’ll keep adding new programs, refactoring old ones, and organizing things better. Feel free to star or fork if you find something useful or interesting!

## 🙌 Contributions?

This is mostly a personal project, but if you’re a fellow learner and want to suggest improvements, ideas, or new logics — I’m always open to learning together!
