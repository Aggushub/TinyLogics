# TinyLogics
TinyLogics is where I drop all the small and interesting programs I've written while learning to code. It's a mix of experiments, logic puzzles, random ideas, and whatever else I felt like building at the moment. Different languages, different vibes â€” all in one place. Just me having fun with code!
