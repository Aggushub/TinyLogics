# 🧠 TinyLogics

Welcome to **TinyLogics** — a growing collection of small, fun, and curious programs I’ve written while learning different programming languages. This repo is a reflection of my coding journey, one logic at a time.

---

## 📌 What is TinyLogics?

**TinyLogics** is my personal sandbox of code — a place where I experiment, build, and learn. These aren't big projects or polished apps, but rather bite-sized programs that helped me understand core concepts, solve logic problems, or just tinker around with code.

Whether it’s a quick C snippet, a Java logic challenge, or a mini script in Python — if I learned something from it, it probably ended up here.

## 💡 Why This Repo?

* To track my learning progress across multiple languages
* To keep my small code experiments organized
* To revisit, reflect, and improve old code over time
* Maybe even help someone else who's learning too!

---

## 🧰 Languages Used

You'll find code in a mix of:

* C
* Java
* Python
* (and maybe more as I explore!)

---

## 🧪 What's Inside?

Here’s a sample of the kinds of things you’ll find here:

* Pattern printing
* Sorting algorithms
* Basic data structures
* Mini logic games
* String & number manipulation scripts
* Random practice problems

---

## 📈 Work in Progress

This is a living repo. As I continue learning, I’ll keep adding new programs, refactoring old ones, and organizing things better. Feel free to star or fork if you find something useful or interesting!

---

## 🙌 Contributions?

This is mostly a personal project, but if you’re a fellow learner and want to suggest improvements, ideas, or new logics — I’m always open to learning together!

## 📬 Let’s Connect

If you're on a similar journey or just love talking code, feel free to reach out or connect!

Let me know if you want to include a table of contents or auto-generated docs for the code files too.
